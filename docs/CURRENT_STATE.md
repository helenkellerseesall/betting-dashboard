## CURRENT ORCHESTRATION

Candidate diversification (`buildCandidateDiversity.js → diversifyCandidates`):
- `maxPerPlayer: 3` · `maxPerGame: 7` · `maxPerStat: 10` · `maxPerStatSide: 6`
- **NEW (Fix 1): modelProb capped at [0.50, 0.55] in diversity sort** — eliminates 1.87× TB-under structural advantage. Mirrors cap in `scoreCandidate` and `scoreLeg`.

Featured side-balance (`buildFeaturedPlays.js → pickDiversified`):
- `maxSideFraction: 0.60` (anchors: 0.55) — fill pass relaxes side cap if short
- Anchors `maxPerGame: 2` — allows cross-side picks in same game

Volatility classification (`buildPortfolioOptimizer.js → VOLATILITY_RULES`):
- `hits`, `runs`, `points`, `rebounds`, `steals`, `stolenbases` etc. → `balanced`
- `pitcherk` / `strikeout` → `balanced`
- `outs` → `balanced` (was `safe` by default)

Composite scoring (`buildFeaturedPlays.js → scoreCandidate`):
- `f.edge = (edge × 4) × clamp(modelProb, 0.50, 0.55)` — caps modelProb compounding
- `tierBoost`: ELITE 0.04 / STRONG 0.02
- `textureBoost`: aggressive/lotto edge>0.045 → 0.018; offensive over edge>0.05 → 0.020; aggressive offensive over → 0.030
- Anchor display: `sortAnchorsForDisplay()` interleaves sides (U·O·U·O·U pattern)

AI slip scoring (`buildSlipAi.js → scoreLeg`):
- Same modelProb cap [0.50, 0.55] as featured
- `tierBoost` halved: ELITE 0.05 / STRONG 0.025

AI slip seeding (`buildSlipAi.js → buildSlipsForTier`):
- **NEW (Fix 2): aggressive tier volatile-first seeding** — aggressive/lotto volatility legs seed before balanced/safe fill. Composite ordering preserved within each subgroup. Safe/balanced/lotto tiers unaffected.
- Premium-edge override: legs with `modelProb >= 0.50 AND edge >= 0.12` bypass `allowedVolatility` and `minModelProb` gates (safe tier). `maxOdds 150` cap still applies.

Featured `buildSafest`:
- Premium-edge override: balanced/aggressive plays with `modelProb >= 0.50 AND edge >= 0.12` qualify alongside standard safe-volatility + 0.55 modelProb gate.

## CURRENT PHASE

**Phase: INTEGRITY + DE-RISK — Phase 7D (Priority 0 done; Fix 3 + Fix 4 unblocked)**

Completed total (all sessions combined):
- AI slip dead fix in `runMlbNight.js`
- Featured anchors vs strong supports two-tier system
- Line shopping re-ranked by implied spread, novelty longshots filtered
- Volatility taxonomy fix — `hits`/`runs`/`points` etc. → `balanced`
- Side-balance caps in `pickDiversified` (`maxSideFraction`)
- Global stat+side orchestration (`maxPerStat`/`maxPerStatSide`)
- Offensive texture bias in aggressive/lotto slip seeds (`offensiveAttackTextureBonus`)
- `AnchorCard` premium display + `attackNote` field
- Scoring ecology fix #1 — modelProb compounding capped at [0.50, 0.55]
- Scoring ecology fix #2 — `isOffensiveAttackStat` + stacked textureBoost
- Anchor cross-side fix — `maxPerGame: 2` in `buildAnchors`
- Trust-curation fix #1 — featured tierBoost halved (ELITE 0.08→0.04, STRONG 0.04→0.02)
- Trust-curation fix #2 — `sortAnchorsForDisplay()` interleave sort
- Trust-qualification fix #1 — slipAi tierBoost halved (ELITE 0.10→0.05, STRONG 0.05→0.025)
- Trust-qualification fix #2 — slipAi safe tier premium-edge override
- Trust-qualification fix #3 — pitcher `outs` → `balanced` volatility
- Trust-qualification fix #4 — `buildSafest` premium-edge override
- Modular extraction #1 — `diversifyCandidates` → `pipeline/shared/buildCandidateDiversity.js`
- Model ecology + trust decompression audit — full lifecycle trace (2026-05-07)
- SQLite Phase 1 storage layer — `backend/storage/` (schema, db, queries, backfill script)
- **NEW: Priority 0 — buildFeaturedPlays fork resolved.**
  Dead import `require("./pipeline/boards/buildFeaturedPlays")` removed from `server.js` line 21.
  `boards/buildFeaturedPlays.js` (407-line NBA-era version) orphaned — zero importers remaining.
  File needs manual deletion (virtiofs blocks sandbox `rm`). Canonical path is now unambiguous:
  `workstationRoutes.js` → `pipeline/shared/buildFeaturedPlays.js` (821-line MLB version).
  All ecology fixes (Fix 1–4) now flow through one deterministic featured-play path.
  Verified: `buildFeaturedPlays` exports correct shape, anchors=5, tonightsBest=5, smartAggression=4, safest=5.
- **NEW: Ecology Fix 1** — modelProb cap [0.50, 0.55] in `diversifyCandidates` sort
  (`buildCandidateDiversity.js` line 51). Eliminates 1.87× TB-under structural advantage.
  Verified: TB under score −0.068, hits over score +0.095, HR lotto +0.141.
  Diversified pool now 34 overs / 27 unders (was under-dominated). Trout runs over at #3.
- **NEW: Ecology Fix 2** — aggressive tier volatile-first seeding in `buildSlipAi.js`
  (`buildSlipsForTier()`, after eligible sort, before seed loop). Aggressive/lotto volatility
  legs seed first; balanced fill afterward. Composite ordering preserved within subgroups.
  Safe/balanced/lotto tiers: zero impact (guard: `if (tier === "aggressive")`).
  Effect: aggressive slips now seed from HR/hits/RBI overs, not TB unders.

## VERIFIED LIVE RESULTS (post-Fix-1, pool of 549 = 299 bets + 250 best)

| Metric | Before Fix 1 | After Fix 1 |
|---|---|---|
| TB under score (edge=0.13, prob=0.68) | 0.354 | 0.286 (−0.068) |
| Hits over score (edge=0.14, prob=0.33) | 0.185 | 0.280 (+0.095) |
| HR lotto score (edge=0.16, prob=0.28) | 0.179 | 0.320 (+0.141) |
| Diversified pool composition | Under-dominated | 34 overs / 27 unders |
| Trout runs over rank | Buried | #3 in pool |
| Freeman RBIs over rank | Buried | #14 in pool |

Fix 2 (aggressive seeding) verified: volatile legs now at seed positions 1–N before balanced fill. Safe/balanced/lotto lanes confirmed unchanged.

## ACTIVE BOTTLENECK

**Remaining ecology compression points (Fix 3 + Fix 4 pending):**

CP3: `buildFeaturedPlays.js` volRealism — lotto=0.46, textureBoost (+0.030) can't cover the gap. Fix: raise lotto→0.56, aggressive→0.66.
CP4: `buildSlipAi.js` lotto decimalOddsRange [25,800] — only 63 valid 4-leg combos. Fix: widen to [20,1500].
CP5: tracked_best missing eventId — zero tier boosts for offensive overs (upstream data quality).
CP6: buildFeaturedPlays fork — server.js still imports old 407-line version (Priority 0, must fix before more scoring work).

Fix 1 + Fix 2 address the two highest-impact compression points. Remaining under-heaviness in the raw pool (83% unders) is a projection-engine artifact, not addressable at the curation layer.

---

## KNOWN WEAKNESSES

1. **Under-heavy raw pool**: ~83% unders in tracked_bets. Source imbalance only addressable in projection engine (out of scope).
2. **`pipeline/boards/buildFeaturedPlays.js` orphaned on disk** — dead import removed from `server.js`, zero remaining importers, needs manual `rm` from macOS terminal. Not a runtime risk (not loaded).
3. **`personal_ledger.json` at 2,000 entries / 2.3MB — PAST SQLite migration trigger.** Write-race orphan `.tmp` file observed. Migration is overdue.
4. **lotto volRealism=0.46** — textureBoost (+0.030) can't compensate the 0.028 weighted gap vs balanced. Fix 3 pending.
5. **lotto decimalOddsRange [25,800]** — only 63 valid 4-leg combos. Fix 4 pending.
6. **tracked_best missing eventId/matchup** — enrichBestEntry ID match always fails → zero tier boosts for all offensive overs.
7. **`timing_intelligence_state.json` at 729KB, unbounded growth.** No pruning mechanism.
8. **`isOffensiveAttackStat` duplicated** between `buildFeaturedPlays.js` and `buildSlipAi.js`. Drift risk.
9. **`http/nbaBestAvailable.inlined.js` (6,867 lines) + `nbaRefreshSnapshot.inlined.js` (4,318 lines)** — may be dead code. Need audit.
10. **Docs duplicated at repo root AND `docs/` folder.** Will diverge.
