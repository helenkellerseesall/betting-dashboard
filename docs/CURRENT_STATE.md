## CURRENT ORCHESTRATION

Candidate diversification (in `workstationRoutes.js` → `diversifyCandidates`):
- `maxPerPlayer: 3` · `maxPerGame: 7` · `maxPerStat: 10` · `maxPerStatSide: 6`

Featured side-balance (`buildFeaturedPlays.js` → `pickDiversified`):
- `maxSideFraction: 0.60` (anchors: 0.55) — fill pass relaxes side cap if short

Volatility classification (`buildPortfolioOptimizer.js` → `VOLATILITY_RULES`):
- `hits`, `runs`, `points`, `rebounds`, `steals` etc. → `balanced` (fixed this session)
- Previous bug: all these fell through to `safe`, inflating volRealism and blocking aggressive slips

---

## CURRENT PHASE

**Phase: CURATION + TRUST + OPERATOR-QUALITY refinement**

Completed this session:
- ✅ Side-balance caps in `pickDiversified` (maxSideFraction)
- ✅ Global stat+side orchestration in `diversifyCandidates` (maxPerStat / maxPerStatSide)
- ✅ Volatility taxonomy fix — hits/runs/points/rebounds → `balanced` not `safe`
- ✅ Offensive texture bias in aggressive/lotto slip seeds (`offensiveAttackTextureBonus`)
- ✅ Anchor card premium display (`AnchorCard` component + `attackNote` field)
- ✅ `buildAttackNote` — sharp one-liner reasons on anchor tier
- ✅ Line shopping re-ranked by implied spread, novelty longshots filtered
- ✅ AI slip dead fix in `runMlbNight.js` (candidate path was wrong)
- ✅ Featured hierarchy: anchors vs strong supports two-tier system

## ACTIVE BOTTLENECK

**Suppression-heavy scoring ecology:**

Raw candidate pool (today): 293 bets — **243 under (83%), 50 over (17%)**
Top raw stats: totalbases 98, hits 84, runs 57, outs 39

Root cause: MLB projection engine naturally produces more unders on lower-offense props
because "hitter under 1.5 hits" has a higher raw implied probability than "hitter over 2.5 TB."
Side-balance caps and texture biases are mitigating this at the surfacing layer,
but the projection engine itself still generates an under-heavy candidate pool.

Current mitigation: ✅ Active (side caps + texture boost)
Remaining work: Scoring ecology review for over archetype representation

---

## KNOWN WEAKNESSES

1. **Under-heavy raw pool**: MLB projection outputs ~83% unders. Curation mitigates but can't fully overcome a 5:1 source imbalance.
2. **NBA line shopping thin**: Multi-book NBA data sparse; shopping view often empty for NBA.
3. **First basket section disconnected**: Renders but lacks real candidate data integration outside FB-specific props.
4. **No SQLite yet**: All persistence is flat JSON. `personal_ledger.json` is a single file that grows unbounded.
5. **`buildIntelligencePresentation.js` oversized**: Contains inline functions that should be extracted to shared modules.
