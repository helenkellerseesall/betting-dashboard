**Live operational repo state. Overwrite every session. Never append.**
_Last updated: 2026-05-11 (Session AN-final: BALANCED allowedVolatility reverted to ["safe","balanced"]; threes route exclusively to AGGRESSIVE/LOTTO; SAFE/BALANCED semantically clean; 1 file modified; TERM 1 restart REQUIRED; Class D verification required before checkpoint)_

## SESSION AN — Tier Semantic Integrity (2026-05-11)

**Scope**: Fix semantic mismatch in NBA SAFE and BALANCED tiers. 3 calibration passes total (AN, AN-2, AN-final). 1 file modified throughout: `backend/pipeline/shared/buildSlipAi.js` (`applyNbaTierOverrides` function only). MLB untouched. Aggressive/lotto output unchanged.

### AN-final: BALANCED allowedVolatility reverted
Live audit after AN-2 showed BALANCED had `odds:+530, vols:[aggressive,aggressive]`. Root: Session AN added `"aggressive"` to BALANCED's `allowedVolatility` to create tier separation — but this routed threes legs (volatility="aggressive") into BALANCED, where two of them could form a +530 aggressive/aggressive parlay. Fix: revert BALANCED `allowedVolatility` to `["safe","balanced"]`. Threes now route exclusively to AGGRESSIVE/LOTTO. The SAFE/BALANCED distinction is maintained by their different odds floors (SAFE dec 1.8 min, BALANCED dec 3.0 min) and other template parameters.

### AN-2 calibration: SAFE ceiling restored
After AN patch, live verification showed SAFE=0. Root: NBA balanced legs (points/rebounds/assists) commonly run +160-+178; two of them combined to dec 6.76-7.73, exceeding the AN ceiling of 6.5. The ceiling was redundant — the original fake-safe scenario (two aggressive threes) is now blocked by `forbidVolatility` **before** the odds check even runs. Restoring ceiling to [1.8, 7.5] re-opens 27/28 balanced-leg pair combinations while zero fake-safe scenarios change.

### Root causes proven (3 converging — original SAFE fake-safe issue)
1. `isPremiumEdgeForSafe` bypass — legs with mp≥0.50 AND edge≥0.12 skipped the `allowedVolatility: ["safe","balanced"]` gate. NBA threes (volatility="aggressive") have mp=0.56-0.62 and edge=0.16-0.23 → always bypassed → entered SAFE.
2. `decimalOddsRange: [1.8, 7.5]` — two +148 legs combined to dec 6.15 (~+515), within ceiling.
3. `maxPerStat: 2` (inherited) — allowed both threes legs to stack. Combined with `maxPerGame:2` and `skipScriptCorrelation:true`, two same-game same-family aggressive legs formed a "SAFE" parlay.

### Files modified (1)
| File | Change |
|---|---|
| `backend/pipeline/shared/buildSlipAi.js` | `applyNbaTierOverrides()`: SAFE adds `forbidVolatility:["lotto","aggressive"]`; `maxPerStat:1`; `decimalOddsRange:[1.8,7.5]`. BALANCED `allowedVolatility:["safe","balanced"]` (AN-final: reverted from ["safe","balanced","aggressive"]). Probe log updated with `forbid` and `mps` fields. |

### NBA SAFE — final state after AN + AN-2 + AN-final
- `forbidVolatility`: `["lotto"]` → **`["lotto","aggressive"]`** — absolute block; cannot be bypassed by `isPremiumEdgeForSafe`. Only balanced/safe-volatility legs (points, rebounds, assists) in SAFE.
- `maxPerStat`: inherited 2 → **1** — no same-stat stacking (no dual points, dual rebounds, etc.)
- `decimalOddsRange`: **`[1.8, 7.5]`** — same as Session AM. Ceiling is now semantically honest because it only admits balanced legs (aggressive is forbidden). 27/28 balanced pair combinations qualify.

### NBA BALANCED — final state after AN-final
- `allowedVolatility`: **`["safe","balanced"]`** — aggressive legs (threes, first_basket) excluded. No aggressive/aggressive pairings possible.
- `allowedSides`: null — both sides (NBA props not script-rotted)
- `maxPerGame`: 2
- `skipScriptCorrelation`: true

### Semantic ladder after AN-final
| Tier | Volatility allowed | Combined dec range |
|---|---|---|
| SAFE | safe, balanced only (NBA: points, rebounds, assists) | [1.8, 7.5] |
| BALANCED | safe + balanced only (NBA: same families as SAFE, different odds floor) | [3.0, 8.0] |
| AGGRESSIVE | balanced + aggressive + lotto | [6.0, 120.0] |
| LOTTO | aggressive + lotto | [20.0, 1500.0] |

Note: SAFE vs BALANCED distinction now rests on odds floor (SAFE admits dec 1.8+, BALANCED admits dec 3.0+) and minModelProb/maxOdds differences, not on volatility tier.

### MLB regression — zero impact
- `applyNbaTierOverrides` gated on `ctx.isNba` — never called for MLB
- MLB SAFE: `forbidVolatility:["lotto"]`, `maxPerStat:2`, `decRange:[1.8,4.0]` — unchanged
- MLB BALANCED: `allowedSides:["under"]`, `allowedVolatility:["safe","balanced","aggressive"]`, `dec[3,8]` — unchanged

### Verification (offline)
| Check | Result |
|---|---|
| `node --check buildSlipAi.js` | ✓ syntax clean |
| NBA SAFE: `forbidVolatility` includes "aggressive" | ✓ |
| NBA SAFE: `maxPerStat` = 1 | ✓ |
| NBA SAFE: `decimalOddsRange` = [1.8, 7.5] | ✓ |
| Two +154/+148 threes → blocked by forbid before odds check | ✓ |
| NBA BALANCED: `allowedVolatility` = ["safe","balanced"] only | ✓ |
| NBA BALANCED: aggressive/aggressive pair impossible | ✓ |
| NBA BALANCED: `allowedSides` = null | ✓ |
| MLB SAFE base template unchanged | ✓ |

### Expected live runtime after TERM 1 restart
- SAFE: ≥ 1 slip (balanced legs only — points/rebounds/assists; no threes/PRA)
- BALANCED: ≥ 1 slip (same volatility families as SAFE, differentiated by odds floor)
- AGGRESSIVE: 4 (unchanged — threes route here)
- LOTTO: 4 (unchanged)
- No BALANCED slip should have any leg with `volatility: "aggressive"`

**TERM 1 restart required: YES** — `buildSlipAi.js` loaded at startup.

## SESSION AM — SAFE/BALANCED Profitability Recovery V1 (2026-05-11)

**Scope**: Restore live NBA SAFE + BALANCED slip generation without touching MLB constraints. 1 file modified: `backend/pipeline/shared/buildSlipAi.js`. NBA-only tier overrides applied via `applyNbaTierOverrides()` gated on `ctx.isNba`. MLB Session AG enforcement (under-only, no rbis/outs, dec[3,8], calibration) fully preserved.

### Live runtime BEFORE (Session AL artifact `verification_nba_2026-05-10_AL-runtime-truth.json`)
- candidates=24, total_slips=8, **safe=0, balanced=0**, aggressive=4, lotto=4
- featured anchors=4, correlation_fields=8

### Live runtime EXPECTED AFTER restart (offline-replicated via `trace_slips.js`)
- candidates=24, total_slips=12, **safe=2, balanced=2**, aggressive=4, lotto=4
- correlation engine still wired; calibration coefficients still applied; AGGRESSIVE/LOTTO freeze unchanged in nightly engines

### Root cause of SAFE=0, BALANCED=0 (proven offline; NOT theory)
With 24-candidate pool from `nba_tracked_bets_2026-05-09.json` (5 eligible) + `buildNbaSnapshotCandidates` (138 → 19 novel after diversify):
1. **SAFE** template required `maxOdds≤150` and `modelProb≥0.55`. NBA base lines run +148 to +200 with mp 0.49–0.62. Only 1 leg passed. 2-leg minimum impossible.
2. **BALANCED** template required `under-only` AND `dec∈[3,8]`. The 7 under-eligible legs combined to dec ≥ 12 (high-edge longshot points unders +360 to +490). 0 valid pairs.
3. **`script_correlation` rule** (canAddLeg) blocked over+over same-game. NBA playoff slate had effectively 1 game on the pool — every cross-player pair hit the same-game block.

### Files modified (1)
| File | Change |
|---|---|
| `backend/pipeline/shared/buildSlipAi.js` | Added `applyNbaTierOverrides(tpl, tier)`; wired into `buildSlipsForTier`; added `skipScriptCorrelation` opt-in to `canAddLeg`'s pace/script rule |

### NBA SAFE override (was → now)
- `minModelProb`: 0.55 → 0.50 (admits NBA's compressed-prob base lines)
- `maxOdds`: 150 → 200 (admits +160-+200 short-priced overs)
- `decimalOddsRange`: [1.8, 4.0] → [1.8, 7.5] (admits 2-leg pairs at ~2.5×2.7 ≈ 6.7 dec)
- `maxPerGame`: 1 → 2 (small NBA slates with 1 game must allow 2 same-game legs)
- `skipScriptCorrelation`: true (NBA correlation handled by `nbaCorrelationEngine`)

### NBA BALANCED override (was → now)
- `allowedSides`: ["under"] → null (NBA usage-driven props are NOT side-asymmetric like MLB)
- `allowedVolatility`: ["safe","balanced","aggressive"] → ["safe","balanced"] (base-line stability only; high-odds aggressive points unders blew dec ceiling)
- `maxPerGame`: 1 → 2 (same reason as SAFE)
- `skipScriptCorrelation`: true
- `decimalOddsRange`, `maxOdds`, `minModelProb`: UNCHANGED

### MLB constraints — UNCHANGED
- `under-only` BALANCED preserved (MLB unders 53.9% vs overs 30.0% over 5 dates)
- `dec[3, 8]` BALANCED preserved
- `maxPerGame=1` SAFE/BALANCED preserved
- `script_correlation` rule still active for MLB (no skip flag)
- `SLIP_EXCLUDED_FAMILIES = {rbis, outs}` preserved
- `FAMILY_CALIBRATION_COEFFICIENTS` preserved
- AGGRESSIVE/LOTTO freeze in nightly engines (`buildMlbSlipEngine.js`, `buildNbaSlipComposer.js`) preserved

### Profitability rationale (per-field, grading-grounded)
- 5-date MLB grading: BALANCED 2.7% hit rate (catastrophic) → MLB stays restricted
- MLB unders (55%) >> MLB overs (37%) → MLB under-only stays
- NBA grading sample too thin (6 settled bets across 5 dates) for side-asymmetry conclusion → NBA both-sides allowed
- NBA SAFE picks generated from current pool: Cade threes o1.5 +154 (mp 0.622, edge 0.228), Harden threes o2.5 +148 (mp 0.564, edge 0.161), Cade assists o10.5 +178 (mp 0.581, edge 0.221) — all ELITE-tier candidates by NBA standards
- NBA BALANCED picks: Harden rebounds o3.5 + Mitchell rebounds u8.5 — opposing-side pace hedge with strong individual edges

### Verification (offline-replicated; live verification REQUIRED for checkpoint)
| Check | Result |
|---|---|
| `node --check buildSlipAi.js` | ✓ syntax clean |
| trace_slips.js (live-route replica): NBA pool | ✓ safe=2 balanced=2 aggressive=4 lotto=4 |
| MLB regression (NBA pool, sport=mlb context): override gate ctx.isNba | ✓ no override applied; tiers identical to pre-AM |
| `[SLIP-PROBE] NBA tier override applied` log present | ✓ fires for both safe + balanced |
| AGGRESSIVE/LOTTO unchanged | ✓ 4 + 4 (same as Session AL) |
| correlation_score_fields populated | ✓ all 12 NBA slips carry field |

## SESSION Y — Repo Constitution Cleanup (Phase 0 + Phase 2)

### Scope (2026-05-09):
Zero-regression structural stabilization. Dead code removal, duplication elimination, mutex integrity fix. No behavior changes to any scoring, ecology, or slip logic.

### Phase 0 — Dead code deleted:

| File | Lines removed | Reason |
|---|---|---|
| `backend/http/nbaBestAvailable.inlined.js` | 6,867 | Confirmed dead — explicitly excluded by nbaIsolatedRoutes.js. 0 importers. |
| `backend/http/nbaRefreshSnapshot.inlined.js` | 4,318 | Confirmed dead — same. 0 importers. |
| `backend/pipeline/enrich/index.js` | 0 (empty) | Empty stub, 0 importers |
| `backend/pipeline/normalize/index.js` | 0 (empty) | Empty stub, 0 importers |
| `backend/pipeline/validation/rows.js` | 0 (empty) | Empty stub, 0 importers |
| `backend/pipeline/snapshot/buildSnapshot.js` | 0 (empty) | Empty stub, 0 importers |
| `backend/storage/betting2.db` | — | Orphan test DB |
| `backend/storage/betting2.db-journal` | — | Stale journal for orphan |
| `backend/storage/test.txt` | — | Empty test artifact |

**Total dead code removed: 11,185 lines. 9 files. 4 empty directories cleaned.**

### Phase 2 — Tactical extractions:

#### Task 1 — `isOffensiveAttackStat` unified

| File | Change |
|---|---|
| `pipeline/shared/normalizers.js` | **NEW** — canonical `isOffensiveAttackStat(fam)` + `normFam(v)`. 54 lines. |
| `pipeline/shared/buildFeaturedPlays.js` | **MODIFIED** — import from normalizers; local 16-line definition removed. |
| `pipeline/shared/buildSlipAi.js` | **MODIFIED** — import from normalizers; inline 8-line `offensive` check replaced with single call. |

**Alignment note**: buildSlipAi previously omitted `doubles` and `triples` from its offensive stat check (accidental omission vs buildFeaturedPlays). The canonical definition now correctly includes both. This is a legitimate alignment, not a regression — doubles/triples are genuine offensive attack stats. Impact is minimal (rare stat families, max +0.032 texture bonus).

#### Task 2 — Compactors extracted

| File | Change |
|---|---|
| `pipeline/shared/buildWorkstationCompactors.js` | **NEW** — `compactLineShopping`, `compactTiming`, `compactPortfolio`. 145 lines. Exact behavior preserved. |
| `routes/workstationRoutes.js` | **MODIFIED** — import from buildWorkstationCompactors; 103-line inline block removed. 721 → 620 lines. |

#### Task 3 — Dual-mutex fixed

| File | Change |
|---|---|
| `backend/server.js` | **MODIFIED** — `/refresh-snapshot` route unified to module-level `__refreshInProgress` / `__lastRefreshTime`. Removed local `let` declarations (lines 19052–19053) and `global.*` assignments (lines 19065, 19068, 19144). Now shares mutex with `/api/best-available`. |

**Mutex before**: `/refresh-snapshot` used `global.__refreshInProgress` (separate scope from module-level). `/api/best-available` used module-level. They could run concurrently.

**Mutex after**: Both routes read/write the same module-level `__refreshInProgress` and `__lastRefreshTime`. Concurrent refresh is now impossible.

### Session Y smoke test results (2026-05-09):

| Test | Result |
|---|---|
| `node --check` all 6 modified/new files | ✓ 6/6 clean |
| Zero deleted-file references remaining | ✓ (nbaRefreshSnapshot comment in nbaIsolatedRoutes is benign) |
| normalizers.js — 23 `isOffensiveAttackStat` cases | ✓ 23/23 pass |
| compactors — null safety + shape tests | ✓ all pass |
| Module resolution (require all new imports) | ✓ all resolve |
| global.* mutex references in server.js | ✓ 0 remaining |
| http/ directory — 2 files only | ✓ mlbIsolatedRoutes.js + nbaIsolatedRoutes.js |
| 4 empty stub directories removed | ✓ enrich/ normalize/ validation/ snapshot/ gone |

**TERM 1 restart required** — server.js modified (mutex fix). workstationRoutes.js modified (compactor import).

## SESSION AE — NBA Result Ingestion Repair (2026-05-10)

**Scope**: Diagnose and repair the NBA grading pipeline. Root cause: `stats.nba.com/stats/scoreboardv2` returns 403 / network block from Node.js servers. The error was caught silently → returned `[]` → "No NBA games found" for every date. Fix: replace with ESPN public API (`site.api.espn.com`) which requires no auth, no special headers, handles regular season + playoffs.

### Root Cause (confirmed):

| Signal | Evidence |
|---|---|
| Error logged but swallowed | `fetchNbaGameIds` catches the 403, logs `console.error`, returns `[]` |
| Output message | "No NBA games found for YYYY-MM-DD" for all 5 dates |
| stats.nba.com behavior | Aggressively blocks non-browser Node.js clients, even with spoofed headers |
| MLB worked | `statsapi.mlb.com` has no such restriction — free, open, no browser check |

### File Modified (1):

| File | Change |
|---|---|
| `pipeline/grading/fetchNbaGameResults.js` | Replace `stats.nba.com/stats/scoreboardv2 + boxscoretraditionalv2` with ESPN public API (`site.api.espn.com/apis/site/v2/sports/basketball/nba/scoreboard + summary`) |

### ESPN API (replacement):

| Endpoint | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `scoreboard?dates=YYYYMMDD&limit=30` | Get ESPN game IDs for a date |
| `summary?event={gameId}` | Get per-player stats for a game |

ESPN stat parsing:
- Integer fields (rebounds, assists, points): `"7"` → `7`
- Ratio fields (threePointFieldGoals): `"2-7"` → `2` (made count parsed from M-A format)
- DNP players: `didNotPlay: true` → skipped (not added to resultMap)
- Zero stats: valid — `0-0` threes → `0` (not null)

### Verification Results:
| Test | Result |
|---|---|
| `node --check` — 1 file | ✓ 1/1 clean |
| parseEspnStat — 13 cases (integers, M-A, edge cases) | ✓ 13/13 |
| getNbaStatValue — 8 cases (all families + null guards) | ✓ 8/8 |
| normName — 3 cases | ✓ 3/3 |
| Full ESPN mock boxscore (5 players, 1 DNP, 2 teams) | ✓ 14/14 |
| Dry-run backfill — 5 NBA dates discovered | ✓ 5/5 |

**TERM 1 restart: NOT required** — `fetchNbaGameResults.js` is a standalone CLI module, not loaded by `server.js`.

**TERM 2 verification required** — run NBA backfill live to confirm ESPN returns real game data.

## SESSION AG — Slip Ecosystem Repair V1 (2026-05-10)

**Scope**: 5 targeted fixes to slip assembly across all 3 slip generation paths. No architecture changes. No rebuild of `combineLegs()`. Additive enforcement only.

### Root Cause (confirmed via code audit):
`buildMlbSlipEngine.js` (canonical nightly MLB path) had `legSize: { target: 3, min: 3, alt: 4 }` — every other BALANCED slip targeted 4 legs; no `maxCombinedDecimalOdds` → combined odds reaching 25.0 (far above 8.0 template ceiling); `MIX_FAMILIES` included rbis/outs; no side filter.

### Files Modified (3):

| File | Session AF Audit Finding | Fix Applied |
|---|---|---|
| `backend/pipeline/mlb/buildMlbSlipEngine.js` | BALANCED 4-leg slips, odds up to 25.0, rbis/outs in mix, no under filter | FIX 1+2+3+4+5 |
| `backend/pipeline/nba/buildNbaSlipComposer.js` | Same violations (minus rbis/outs — N/A for NBA) | FIX 1+2+4+5 |
| `backend/pipeline/shared/buildSlipAi.js` | Already had [2,3] legCount; needed under filter, rbis/outs exclusion, calibration | FIX 2+3+5 |

### Five Fixes:

**FIX 1 — Nightly template enforcement (MLB + NBA engines)**
- `legSize: { target: 3, min: 2 }` — removed `alt: 4` (was producing 4-leg BALANCED slips)
- `maxCombinedDecimalOdds: 8.0` — hard ceiling on combined parlay odds (was unbounded → up to 25.0)
- `minCombinedDecimalOdds: 3.0` — floor to prevent trivially low-variance slips
- `maxSameEventShare: 0.30` → for 3-leg slips: maxPerEvent = max(1, ceil(3×0.30)) = 1 (enforces maxPerGame=1)
- `droppedSlips` counter added to `meta` output for audit of rejected slips

**FIX 2 — BALANCED over exclusion (all 3 paths)**
- `sideFilter: ["under"]` explicit in `buildBalancedSlips()` pool filter (MLB + NBA engines)
- `allowedSides: ["under"]` in `TIER_TEMPLATES.balanced` (buildSlipAi.js)
- Enforced in `buildSlipsForTier` eligible filter: `if (tpl.allowedSides?.length && !tpl.allowedSides.includes(leg.side)) return false`

**FIX 3 — rbis/outs exclusion from slip assembly (MLB paths only)**
- `BALANCED_FAMILIES = new Set(["hits", "totalBases", "ks", "runs", "hitsAllowed"])` in buildMlbSlipEngine.js
- `SLIP_EXCLUDED_FAMILIES = new Set(["rbis", "outs"])` in buildSlipAi.js
- Both remain valid for individual bets and ladder picks — only excluded from slip parlays

**FIX 4 — AGGRESSIVE/LOTTO freeze (all 3 paths)**
- `FREEZE_AGGRESSIVE_LOTTO = true` module-level constant (reversible — flip to `false` to re-enable)
- Frozen paths produce `[]` (not errors); `meta.frozenTiers: ["aggressive", "lotto"]` auditable in output
- Comment in all 3 files: "remove freeze when post-repair grading confirms tier health"

**FIX 5 — combinedModelProb calibration correction (all 3 paths)**
- Family-level calibration coefficients derived from 5-date MLB grading aggregate:
  ```
  totalbases: 0.97, hits: 0.80, runs: 0.74, rbis: 0.68, outs: 0.72,
  ks: 0.85, hr: 0.72, hitsallowed: 0.82
  NBA: rebounds: 0.87, assists: 0.90, points: 0.88, threes: 0.88, blocks: 0.85, steals: 0.85
  ```
- `rawCombinedModelProb` preserved on every slip object for pre-calibration audit diff
- `combinedModelProb` = product of per-leg `(modelProb × familyCoeff)` clamped [0.001, 0.999]

### Smoke Test Results (all 3 paths):

| `node --check` | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| SAFE slips produced | 2 ✓ | 2 ✓ | ✓ |

**All checks: PASS ✓**

### Verification Class: D

**TERM 1 restart required: YES**
- `buildSlipAi.js` is loaded by `server.js` at startup — server must be restarted before workstation slips reflect fixes.
- `buildMlbSlipEngine.js` and `buildNbaSlipComposer.js` are called by the nightly pipeline at runtime — fixes active after any new nightly run.

**Snapshot hard-reset required: YES (Class D mandatory)**
```bash
curl -s "http://localhost:4000/refresh-snapshot/hard-reset"
```
(wait 10s, then run verification)

**Verification command (TERM 2, after hard-reset):**
```bash
node backend/scripts/runVerification.js --sport=nba --session=AG-repair
```
Expected: exit 0

**Checkpoint (ONLY after runVerification exits 0):**
```bash
node backend/scripts/checkpointRepo.js "Session AG: Slip Ecosystem Repair V1 — BALANCED enforcement + calibration + freeze"
```

### Post-Repair Grading (operator, after next nightly run):
```bash
node backend/scripts/runHistoricalGrade.js --sport=mlb --backfill
node backend/scripts/runHistoricalGrade.js --sport=nba --backfill
```
Confirms new BALANCED tier health with calibration active. Once tier hit rates ≥ 52%: unfreeze AGGRESSIVE/LOTTO by setting `FREEZE_AGGRESSIVE_LOTTO = false` in all 3 files.

## SESSION AD — Historical Grading + Reconciliation Pipeline (2026-05-10)

**Scope**: Automated grading infrastructure. Fetch actual game results from MLB Stats API and NBA Stats API, settle individual tracked bets (win/loss/push/unresolved/pending), settle slip parlays from leg results, compute ROI/hit-rate summaries per tier/statFamily/side. Backfill runner for all pending dates.

### Files Created (6 new files — 0 existing files modified):

| File | Description |
|---|---|
| `pipeline/grading/fetchMlbGameResults.js` | MLB Stats API fetcher — schedule + boxscore, all batting+pitching stat families, parallel game processing, normName-keyed Map |
| `pipeline/grading/fetchNbaGameResults.js` | NBA Stats API fetcher — scoreboardv2 + boxscoretraditionalv2, required headers, sequential with 500ms delay, graceful degradation |
| `pipeline/grading/gradeTrackedBets.js` | Per-bet settlement — resultsMap lookup, settleFromActual(), result/actualValue/settledAt write-back, atomic tmp→rename |
| `pipeline/grading/gradeTrackedSlips.js` | Slip parlay settlement — leg lookup from graded bets, parlay logic (all-win=win, any-loss=loss, push propagation), atomic write |
| `pipeline/grading/buildGradingSummary.js` | ROI/hit-rate summary — byTier, byStatFamily, bySide, slip byType, American odds ROI, writes grading_summary_{sport}_{date}.json |
| `scripts/runHistoricalGrade.js` | Main runner — --sport, --date, --backfill, --retry-unresolved, --summary-only, --dry-run, --verbose flags; discovers pending dates automatically |

### MLB stat family mapping:
| statFamily | API field |
|---|---|
| hits | batting.hits |
| hr | batting.homeRuns |
| runs | batting.runs |
| rbis | batting.rbi |
| totalBases | batting.totalBases |
| walks | batting.baseOnBalls |
| ks | pitching.strikeOuts |
| outs | pitching.outs (pitcher outs recorded) |

### NBA stat family mapping:
| statFamily | API field |
|---|---|
| rebounds | REB (total rebounds from boxscoretraditionalv2) |
| threes | FG3M (3-pointers made) |
| assists | AST |
| points | PTS |

### Result state machine:
- `"pending"` → player not found in resultsMap (game not played / API miss) — retryable
- `"unresolved"` → player found but stat family couldn't be extracted — retryable
- `"win"` / `"loss"` / `"push"` → settled from actual value

### Slip settlement rules:
- All legs win → "win"
- Any leg loses → "loss" (even with other wins/pushes)
- All win or push (≥1 push) → "push"
- Any unresolved → "unresolved"
- Any pending → "pending"

### Verification Results:
| Test | Result |
|---|---|
| `node --check` — 6 files | ✓ 6/6 clean |
| settleFromActual — 7 cases (over/under/push/null) | ✓ 7/7 pass |
| MLB getStatValue — 10 cases (all families + null guard) | ✓ 10/10 pass |
| NBA getNbaStatValue — 5 cases | ✓ 5/5 pass |
| normName — 2 cases | ✓ 2/2 pass |
| dry-run backfill — 10 date+sport combos discovered | ✓ 10/10 |
| summary-only run — grading_summary_mlb_2026-05-08.json written | ✓ valid JSON |

### Usage:
```bash
# Grade a specific date:
node backend/scripts/runHistoricalGrade.js --sport=mlb --date=2026-05-08
node backend/scripts/runHistoricalGrade.js --sport=nba --date=2026-05-07

# Backfill all pending dates (both sports):
node backend/scripts/runHistoricalGrade.js --sport=all --backfill

# Retry unresolved bets (player found but stat missing):
node backend/scripts/runHistoricalGrade.js --sport=all --backfill --retry-unresolved

# Just regenerate summaries from existing graded data:
node backend/scripts/runHistoricalGrade.js --sport=mlb --date=2026-05-08 --summary-only
```

### What activates after first successful run:
1. `personal_ledger.json` settled entries → calibration > 0
2. `buildDailyIntelligenceReview` → real calibration data flows
3. `buildPostGameReview` → settled bets unblock review engine
4. `grading_summary_{sport}_{date}.json` → ROI/hit-rate per tier visible

**TERM 1 restart: NOT required** — no existing files modified.

## SESSION AC — NBA-2.B: Canonical Volatility Resolver Extraction (2026-05-09)

**Scope**: Create `pipeline/nba/nbaVolatilityResolver.js` as the single canonical authority for NBA volatility interpretation. Replace fragmented inline guards in `buildFeaturedPlays.js` and `buildSlipAi.js` with a single resolver import. Extract, canonicalize, and eliminate all duplicate guard logic.

### Files Changed (3 files):

| File | Change |
|---|---|
| `pipeline/nba/nbaVolatilityResolver.js` | **NEW (95 lines)** — canonical authority; `nbaVolatilityResolve(raw)` + `resolveNbaVolatility(raw)` |
| `pipeline/shared/buildFeaturedPlays.js` | Import: `classifyVolatility` → `resolveNbaVolatility`; inline guard (12 lines) → single resolver call |
| `pipeline/shared/buildSlipAi.js` | Import: `classifyVolatility` → `resolveNbaVolatility`; inline guard (13 lines) → single resolver call |

**`VOLATILITY_RULES` NOT modified. `classifyVolatility()` NOT modified. MLB behavior unchanged.**

### Resolver Resolution Priority (first-match wins):

```javascript
// 1. Snapshot-sourced stamp preservation (any valid volatility from buildNbaSnapshotCandidates)
if (raw.snapshotSourced === true && VALID_VOLATILITY.has(raw.volatility)) {
  return { volatility: raw.volatility, source: "snapshot_stamped" }
}
// 2. Role-spike / eruption-environment hook [documented no-op — NBA-6 scope]
// 3. VOLATILITY_RULES fallback — classifyVolatility(raw)
return { volatility: classifyVolatility(raw), source: "rules" }
```

### Expansion vs NBA-1 guard:

NBA-1 guard was narrow: `snapshotSourced === true && volatility === "lotto"` only.

NBA-2.B resolver preserves ALL valid snapshotSourced stamps:
- PRA → "lotto" (NBA-1 preserved — most critical)
- threes / first_basket → "aggressive" (NEW: was silently reclassified to "balanced" by VOLATILITY_RULES threes-balanced rule)
- points / rebounds / assists → "balanced" (already correct via VOLATILITY_RULES, now explicit)

### Duplication Points Eliminated:

| Previously | Now |
|---|---|
| 12-line inline guard in `buildFeaturedPlays.normalizeCandidate()` | Removed |
| 13-line inline guard in `buildSlipAi.normalizeCandidate()` | Removed |
| `classifyVolatility` imported directly in both shared modules | Removed from both |
| Snapshotted volatility semantics split across 2 files | Unified in 1 resolver |

### Verification Results:

| Test | Result |
|---|---|
| `node --check` — 3 files | ✓ 3/3 clean |
| Resolver logic — 20 cases (snapshot stamps, MLB, rules, edge cases, source tags) | ✓ 20/20 |
| MLB regression — buildFeaturedPlays full run | ✓ 0 regressions |
| NBA PRA snap → lotto via resolver | ✓ |
| NBA threes snap → aggressive via resolver (NEW vs NBA-1) | ✓ |
| Non-snapshot PRA → aggressive (VOLATILITY_RULES fallback) | ✓ |
| buildSlipAi full run — PRA legs volatility preserved | ✓ |
| Inline guards remaining outside resolver | ✓ 0 |
| Global snapshotSourced guard count outside resolver | ✓ 0 |
| MLB imports unchanged | ✓ |

### Remaining Volatility Drift Risks:

1. **buildNbaSnapshotCandidates still inline in workstationRoutes.js** — the PRODUCER of volatility stamps is not yet extracted. Phase 2.C. No behavioral risk; the resolver correctly consumes whatever stamps arrive.
2. **Nightly path (buildNbaBestBetsBoard → buildNbaSlipComposer) does NOT call the resolver** — `bestBetsBoard.allPlays.volatility` is set without the resolver. Phase 2.F audit + wire required.
3. **buildNbaAiSlips.js helper trio doesn't call the resolver** — `collectFullPool` / `filterSlipLegs` / `formatLeg` have their own `legVolatility()` numeric scale (0.92–1.18). These are consumed only by the dead orphan `buildNbaDynamicSlipEngine` and the currently-unused function bodies. Phase 2.D quarantine + Phase 2.E deletion.
4. **VOLATILITY_RULES threes-balanced rule remains** — VOLATILITY_RULES maps `threes < 3.5` → balanced. The resolver correctly overrides this for snapshot-sourced candidates. Non-snapshot threes still land as balanced, which is correct behavior for MLB/non-snap NBA.

### NBA-2.C Inheritance Notes:

When `buildNbaSnapshotCandidates` is extracted to `pipeline/nba/buildNbaSnapshotCandidates.js` (Phase 2.C):
- The inline volatility stamping logic (`family === "pra" ? "lotto" : ...`) should remain in that file as the producer
- The resolver remains the consumer authority — the two roles are intentionally separate
- No changes to the resolver required for 2.C

**TERM 1 restart required** — `buildFeaturedPlays.js` and `buildSlipAi.js` both modified.

## SESSION AB — NBA-2: Canonical Path Constitution Audit (2026-05-09)

**Scope**: Read-only Opus audit. Full importer trace of every NBA slip-related module. Constitutional designation of canonical-nightly + canonical-workstation slip surfaces. 20-section deliverable. Zero code changes. Zero TERM 1 restart.

**Output**: `docs/NBA_CANONICAL_PATH_AUDIT_2026-05-09.md` — 20 sections, NBA Routing Health Score 4.6/10.

### Critical structural correction to Session Z audit:

The Session Z NBA Ecology Audit framing of "5 overlapping NBA slip builders" was misleading. Direct importer trace proves:

| Module | True status | Importers (live) |
|---|---|---|
| `buildNbaSlipComposer.js` | **CANONICAL nightly slip engine** | `buildNbaOpportunityBoard.js:13` → called line 257 → output written to `nba_tracked_slips_*.json` via `persistTrackedToday` |
| `buildNbaAiPicks.js` | **CANONICAL nightly pick scorer + aiRange attacher** | `buildNbaOpportunityBoard.js:9` → called line 238 |
| `buildNbaPlayerOutcomePredictions.js` | **CANONICAL nightly prediction engine** | `buildNbaOpportunityBoard.js:11` → called line 242 |
| `buildNbaBestBetsBoard.js` | **CANONICAL nightly board surface** | `buildNbaOpportunityBoard.js:12` → called line 251 |
| `buildNbaAiSlips.js` | **UTILITY-ONLY** — `buildNbaAiSlips()` function has ZERO importers; only its helper trio is consumed | `buildNbaPlayerOutcomePredictions` (`collectFullPool`), `buildNbaDynamicSlipEngine` (`collectFullPool`/`filterSlipLegs`/`formatLeg`) |
| `buildNbaDynamicSlipEngine.js` | **DEAD ORPHAN** with valuable correlation logic | zero importers (only comment-mention in nbaSlipLegConstraints.js) |
| `buildNbaSlipEngine.js` | **DEAD ORPHAN** | zero importers (only comment-mention in nbaAiStatFamilyRank.js) |
| `buildSlipAi.js` (shared) | **CANONICAL workstation slip regenerator** | `workstationRoutes.js:251` → called line 352 (every `/api/ws/state` request) |

### NBA Routing Health Score:

| Dimension | Score |
|---|---|
| Canonical-engine clarity | 4.5/10 |
| Dead-code namespace pollution | 3.5/10 |
| Workstation/nightly symmetry | 3.0/10 |
| Correlation logic ownership | 2.0/10 |
| aiRange resolution propagation | 5.0/10 |
| snapshotSourced flow | 7.0/10 |
| Volatility ownership | 4.5/10 |
| Tier ownership | 3.5/10 |
| Same-player suppression | 6.0/10 |
| Workstation compatibility | 6.5/10 |
| **OVERALL NBA ROUTING** | **4.6/10** |

### Critical findings beyond Session Z:

1. **`aiRange` is computed by `buildNbaAiPicks` but consumed by NEITHER active engine.** `buildSlipAi` doesn't import `nbaAiOutcomeRange`. `buildNbaSlipComposer` operates on `bestBetsBoard.allPlays` which doesn't carry `aiRange`. The two DEAD engines (`buildNbaAiSlips` + `buildNbaDynamicSlipEngine`) DO consume it. This is the single largest architectural gap — ladder ranges are computed and never reach the slip layer.

2. **All correlation logic (pairwiseStackBoost, jointProbabilityWithCorrelation, isFastCashoutLeg, ensureFastLegsLead) lives in the orphan `buildNbaDynamicSlipEngine.js`.** The active path has zero correlation. Must be absorbed BEFORE deletion (Phase 2.G).

3. **The NBA-1 snapshotSourced guard does NOT propagate to the nightly path.** `buildNbaSnapshotCandidates` (workstation only) is the sole setter of `snapshotSourced: true`. Nightly candidates flow through `classifyVolatility` unguarded. Phase 2.F audit + wiring required.

4. **Two slip surfaces (`slipBets` + `aiSlips`) coexist in `/api/ws/state` with no constitutional documentation.** `slipBets` = nightly engine-grade (Composer output); `aiSlips` = workstation regenerated (buildSlipAi). Both reach the bettor.

5. **`buildNbaSnapshotCandidates` is NBA-specific but lives inline in workstationRoutes.js** (~70 lines, pollutes the supposedly sport-agnostic routes file). Phase 2.C extraction prerequisite for NBA-3.

### NBA-2 Migration Plan (9 phases, post-AB sessions):

| Phase | Task | Model | Risk |
|---|---|---|---|
| 2.A | ARCHITECTURE.md + types.ts comments updated | Sonnet | Zero |
| 2.B | Create `pipeline/nba/nbaVolatilityResolver.js`; replace inline NBA-1 guards | Sonnet | Low |
| 2.C | Extract `buildNbaSnapshotCandidates` from workstationRoutes → `pipeline/nba/` | Sonnet | Near-zero |
| 2.D | Create `pipeline/nba/nbaSlipUtils.js`; quarantine buildNbaAiSlips to shim | Sonnet | Low |
| 2.E | Delete `buildNbaSlipEngine.js` + orphan function bodies in `buildNbaAiSlips.js` | Sonnet | Low |
| 2.F | Audit + wire bestBetsBoard volatility to resolver | Sonnet | Medium |
| 2.G | Extract `pipeline/nba/nbaCorrelation.js` from DynamicSlipEngine; wire into buildSlipAi NBA branch | **Opus** | Medium-high |
| 2.H | Delete `buildNbaDynamicSlipEngine.js` (after 2.G stable) | Sonnet | Low |
| 2.I | Wire aiRange into buildSlipAi NBA branch | **Opus** | High |

### What must never change (from this audit):
- `nbaAiOutcomeRange.js` (computeOutcomeRange, resolveLegFromAiRange, resolveLottoLegAboveCeiling)
- `nbaAiStatFamilyRank.js` (role/stat alignment, statStabilityWeight table)
- `nbaPropLanes.js` (CORE_LANES / COMBO_LANES taxonomy)
- `passesEliteTierGate` numeric thresholds (NBA-4 scope only)
- `compositeRankScore` weights (NBA-5 scope only)
- NBA-1 snapshotSourced guard pattern (extracted to resolver but contract preserved)
- `VOLATILITY_RULES` static table itself
- `f.edge = (edge × 4) × clamp(modelProb, 0.50, 0.55)` cap (Sessions T-V)
- `/api/ws/*` response shape (`slipBets`, `aiSlips`, `featured`)
- `applyEdgeToNbaRows` apply order
- `dominanceGap` filter
- `pseudoThrees` logic in buildNbaAiPicks
- `persistTrackedToday` atomic-rename pattern

### Pending checkpoint:
- Files added (1): `docs/NBA_CANONICAL_PATH_AUDIT_2026-05-09.md` (~1,150 lines)
- Files modified (2): `CURRENT_STATE.md`, `NEXT_SESSION.md` (Session AB section + roadmap)
- Code mutations: 0
- TERM 1 restart: NO (read-only)

## SESSION AA — NBA-1: PRA Volatility Guard (2026-05-09)

**Scope**: Surgical fix to preserve PRA/combo-stat `volatility: "lotto"` stamps that `buildNbaSnapshotCandidates()` (workstationRoutes.js FIX Q4) applies on snapshot candidates. Previously, `normalizeCandidate()` in both downstream modules unconditionally called `classifyVolatility(raw)`, which overwrites "lotto" with "aggressive" (VOLATILITY_RULES: `combo/pra → aggressive`). NBA-1 adds a narrow guard that skips reclassification when the candidate is confirmed snapshot-sourced and already stamped lotto. MLB candidates never set `snapshotSourced` — zero MLB behavior change.

### Files Modified (3 edits, 2 files):

| File | Change | Lines |
|---|---|---|
| `pipeline/shared/buildFeaturedPlays.js` | `normalizeCandidate()`: snapshotSourced "lotto" guard | ~87–97 |
| `pipeline/shared/buildFeaturedPlays.js` | `scoreCandidate()` volRealism: lotto → 0.65 explicit slot (was 0.56 fallthrough) | ~130 |
| `pipeline/shared/buildSlipAi.js` | `normalizeCandidate()`: same snapshotSourced "lotto" guard | ~113–124 |

**VOLATILITY_RULES NOT modified.** `classifyVolatility()` NOT modified. `SAFE` lane unchanged. MLB ecology unchanged.

### Guard Logic (identical in both modules):
```javascript
// NBA-1: Preserve snapshotSourced volatility for lotto-stamped candidates.
// buildNbaSnapshotCandidates() (workstationRoutes.js FIX Q4) stamps
// volatility: "lotto" on PRA combo candidates and snapshotSourced: true.
// Without this guard, classifyVolatility() overwrites with "aggressive"
// (VOLATILITY_RULES: combo/pra → aggressive), blocking PRA from the lotto
// slip tier and penalizing it in volRealism scoring vs balanced stats.
// Guard is narrow: only preserves "lotto" stamps from confirmed snapshot
// source. MLB candidates never set snapshotSourced — no MLB behavior change.
// VOLATILITY_RULES itself is NOT modified.
volatility: (raw.snapshotSourced === true && raw.volatility === "lotto")
              ? "lotto"
              : classifyVolatility(raw),
```

### volRealism Fix (buildFeaturedPlays.js only):
```javascript
// NBA-1: lotto gets its own slot (0.65 ≈ aggressive 0.66) rather than the
// generic 0.56 fallthrough. Without this, PRA candidates correctly preserved
// as "lotto" score ~0.01 lower than equivalent aggressive plays — suppressing
// PRA ecosystem surfacing despite the classification fix.
f.volRealism = c.volatility === "safe" ? 0.80 :
               c.volatility === "balanced" ? 0.74 :
               c.volatility === "aggressive" ? 0.66 :
               c.volatility === "lotto" ? 0.65 :
               0.56
```

### Verification Results:
| Test | Result |
|---|---|
| `node --check` — 4 affected files | ✓ 4/4 clean |
| Guard logic — 15 test cases | ✓ 15/15 pass |
| MLB regression test | ✓ 0 regressions |
| buildAiSlips full run — PRA classification | ✓ PRA → "lotto", seeds aggressive slips |
| buildFeaturedPlays full run — bestPra | ✓ 4 plays all "lotto", smartAggression surfaces PRA |
| SAFE lane | ✓ clean, no lotto contamination |
| LOTTO slips populated | ⚠ empty (expected — odds gate NBA-3 scope) |

### Intentional Design Tradeoffs:
- PRA reclassified as "lotto" loses balanced tier access (`allowedVolatility: ["safe","balanced","aggressive"]` — lotto not included). This is correct: combo stats do not belong in balanced slips.
- PRA retains aggressive tier access (lotto is in `["balanced","aggressive","lotto"]`).
- LOTTO slips remain sparse because base-odds legs (dec ~5–9 each, 5-leg combo ~22–26) barely reach the [20, 1500] gate. NBA-3 (alt line gate) is the structural fix.

### NBA-2 Inheritance from NBA-1:
- `buildNbaAiSlips.js` (canonical path) has its own `normalizeCandidate()` — NBA-2 must apply the same snapshotSourced guard OR ensure lotto stamps flow through its input pool without reclassification
- The volRealism fix is in `buildFeaturedPlays.js` only — NBA-2 canonical slip scoring path must be audited separately (Opus)
- `snapshotSourced: true` flag is the sentinel — NBA-2 input shape must preserve this field when piping workstation pool into buildNbaAiSlips

**TERM 1 restart required** — `buildFeaturedPlays.js` and `buildSlipAi.js` both modified; both are loaded at startup.

## SESSION Z — NBA Ecology Constitution Audit (2026-05-09)

**Scope**: Read-only philosophical + architectural audit. Zero code changes. Zero regressions. Zero TERM 1 restart required.

**Output**: `docs/NBA_ECOLOGY_AUDIT_2026-05-09.md` — 20 sections, NBA Ecology Health Score 2.9/10.

### NBA Ecology Health Score Summary:

| Dimension | Score |
|---|---|
| Candidate diversity | 3.5/10 |
| Volatility ecosystem richness | 2.0/10 |
| Role-spike surfacing | 2.0/10 |
| Ladder coherence | 2.5/10 |
| Eruption environment | 1.0/10 |
| First-basket ecosystem | 2.0/10 |
| Aggression tier authenticity | 3.0/10 |
| Same-game correlation logic | 4.0/10 |
| **OVERALL** | **2.9/10** |

### 8 Critical Failures Confirmed:

1. **Two-path disconnect** — workstation uses MLB-calibrated shared path; NBA-specific builders orphaned
2. **realismScore monoculture** — 70% weight guarantees star dominance; 3× edge cannot overcome gap
3. **Lotto starvation** — structural failure on both paths; fallback mirrors aggressive
4. **aiRange crippled** — alt line gate (`propVariant !== "base"`) kills floor/median/ceiling resolution
5. **No ecology tier layer** — NBA has no equivalent of MLB's ELITE/STRONG stamps
6. **Model signal weak** — nbaModelSignals.js is 82–92% market-following; can't detect role spikes
7. **Eruption environment absent** — no NBA analog to MLB HR candidate ecosystem
8. **Five overlapping builders** — philosophically incompatible; buildNbaSlipEngine.js is random, not intelligent

### NBA Evolution Roadmap (7 phases):

| Phase | Task | Model | Priority |
|---|---|---|---|
| NBA-1 | PRA volatility fix — Path A (snapshot-sourced field) | Sonnet | 🔴 Now |
| NBA-2 | Designate buildNbaAiSlips as canonical workstation path | Opus audit first | 🔴 Now |
| NBA-3 | Allow quality alt lines through workstation gate | Sonnet | 🟡 After NBA-2 |
| NBA-4 | Build NBA Ecology Tier Layer (ELITE/STRONG stamps) | Sonnet | 🟡 After NBA-3 |
| NBA-5 | Reduce realismScore weight 0.70 → 0.45; raise probability 0.15→0.25, edge 0.10→0.20 | Opus audit first | 🟡 After NBA-4 |
| NBA-6 | Add eruption environment detection (role-spike, blowout-risk, pace escalation) | Sonnet | 🟢 After NBA-5 |
| NBA-7 | Wire first basket to workstation (alt market accumulation) | Sonnet | 🟢 After NBA-6 |

### What must eventually die (from audit):
- `buildNbaSlipEngine.js` — random Math.random() picker, philosophically incompatible
- `buildNbaSlipComposer.js` — field naming mismatches, requires `bestBetsBoard` format no longer current
- `buildNbaDynamicSlipEngine.js` — parallel system with incompatible "lotto" semantics; absorb correlation logic into buildNbaAiSlips first

### What must never change (from audit):
- `pairwiseStackBoost()` correlation logic in DynamicSlipEngine (absorb into canonical path first)
- aiRange resolution architecture (floor/median/ceiling/lotto leg resolution)
- Lane separation (CORE_LANES vs COMBO_LANES vs special)
- `roleStatScoreBump` logic in nbaAiStatFamilyRank.js
- statStabilityWeight table
- SAFE archetype two-leg / elite-only constraint
- `maxSameGame` constraints
- MLB ecology (any NBA changes must not touch MLB path)

## SESSION W — Daily Intelligence Review Engine

See previous CURRENT_STATE for full Session W details. All Session W systems remain active.

---

## CURRENT ORCHESTRATION

Candidate diversification (`buildCandidateDiversity.js → diversifyCandidates`):
- `maxPerPlayer: 3` · `maxPerGame: 7 (MLB) / 12 (NBA)` · `maxPerStat: 10` · `maxPerStatSide: 6`

Featured side-balance (`buildFeaturedPlays.js → pickDiversified`):
- `maxSideFraction: 0.60` (anchors: 0.55)

Volatility classification (`buildPortfolioOptimizer.js → VOLATILITY_RULES`):
- `threes < 3.5 → balanced`, `threes >= 3.5 → lotto`, `PRA/combo → aggressive`, `odds >= 350 → lotto`

NBA snapshot candidate pipeline:
- Gates: core odds (-200..+200), no alternate/ladder keys, known stat family, mp≥0.35, edge≥0.03
- Top 150 by edge

---

## ACTIVE BOTTLENECKS

**NBA lotto pool seeds correctly (NBA-1 ✅)** — snapshotSourced PRA candidates now classify as "lotto" through the guard. Remaining gap: base-odds legs (dec ~5–9) combine to dec ~12–26, borderline for the [20, 1500] gate. Requires NBA-3 (alt line gate) + NBA-2 (canonical path) to fully populate lotto slips.

**First basket bucket empty.** `first_basket` family absent from base snapshot — alt markets only.

---

## KNOWN WEAKNESSES

1. **NBA lotto slips still odds-gated** — NBA-1 ✅ fixed classification (PRA now seeds as "lotto"). Remaining blocker: base odds dec ~5–9 per leg; 5-leg combo ~22–26 barely clears lotto gate [20, 1500]. NBA-3 (alt line gate) is the next lever; NBA-2 (canonical path) is prerequisite.
2. **NBA first basket bucket empty** — needs alt market accumulation
3. **NBA smartAggression limited** — only PRA gets `aggressive`
4. **NBA tracked_bets pool thin** — 2 bets today
5. **NBA SP4 (combo PA/PR/RA)** — resolveStatFamily returns null. Deferred.
6. **NBA SP1 (bestProps empty)** — hardcoded empty. Deferred.
7. **`personal_ledger.json` all 2,000 entries pending** — grading pipeline now built (Session AD); run `node backend/scripts/runHistoricalGrade.js --sport=all --backfill` to settle
8. **tracked_best missing eventId/matchup** — tier boosts always fail; Priority 3
9. **Duplicate balanced slip issue (seenSignatures)** — deferred
10. **`timing_intelligence_state.json` at 729KB, unbounded growth** — no pruning
11. **Under-heavy raw NBA pool (~67% unders)** — source imbalance
12. **Under-heavy raw MLB pool (~83% unders)** — same
13. **Daily intelligence review calibration = 0** — grading pipeline built (Session AD); run backfill to activate
14. **Intelligence review steam/book answers empty** — steam_summary_json placeholder; needs line shopping data wired
15. **NBA ecology — two-path disconnect** — workstation uses shared buildSlipAi.js (MLB-calibrated); nightly uses buildNbaSlipComposer (canonical-nightly, confirmed Session AB). The other 3 "NBA slip builders" are: buildNbaAiSlips (utility-only — function unused), buildNbaDynamicSlipEngine (DEAD orphan, but holds all correlation logic — must be absorbed not deleted), buildNbaSlipEngine (DEAD orphan). See NBA_CANONICAL_PATH_AUDIT_2026-05-09.md.
16. **NBA monoculture root cause confirmed** — realismScore×0.70 weight mathematically guarantees star dominance. Star finalWeight ≈1.62, backup with 3× edge ≈1.25. Gap is structural.
17. **NBA lotto starvation fully traced** — two failure paths: shared path (maxOdds 600 impossible at base), nightly path (aiRange requires alt lines killed by workstation gate). Fallback: copies aggressive.
18. **NBA intelligence health: 2.9/10** — 8 critical failures audited. Full roadmap NBA-1→NBA-7 in docs/NBA_ECOLOGY_AUDIT_2026-05-09.md.
19. **`tracker/betTracker.js` vs `buildPersonalLedger.js`** — two parallel bet tracking systems, no reconciliation (betTracker is legacy)

**RESOLVED SESSION AG:**
- ~~BALANCED 4-leg slips produced by nightly MLB engine~~ — `alt: 4` removed; `legSize: { target: 3, min: 2 }` enforced ✓
- ~~Combined odds reaching 25.0 on BALANCED slips~~ — `maxCombinedDecimalOdds: 8.0` / `minCombinedDecimalOdds: 3.0` enforced ✓
- ~~rbis/outs appearing in slip parlays~~ — excluded via `BALANCED_FAMILIES` (MLB engine) and `SLIP_EXCLUDED_FAMILIES` (buildSlipAi) ✓
- ~~Overs appearing in BALANCED slips~~ — `sideFilter: ["under"]` / `allowedSides: ["under"]` enforced across all 3 paths ✓
- ~~combinedModelProb confidence inflation (uncalibrated joint probability)~~ — family-level coefficients applied; `rawCombinedModelProb` preserved for audit ✓
- ~~AGGRESSIVE/LOTTO tiers producing contaminated slips~~ — frozen (`FREEZE_AGGRESSIVE_LOTTO = true`); reversible; auditable in `meta.frozenTiers` ✓
- ~~Rejected slips unauditable~~ — `meta.droppedSlips` counter added to composer output ✓

**RESOLVED SESSION AC:**
- ~~Inline snapshotSourced guards fragmented across 2 shared modules~~ — extracted to `pipeline/nba/nbaVolatilityResolver.js`; resolver is sole canonical authority ✓
- ~~`classifyVolatility` imported directly by shared modules for NBA logic~~ — removed from both; resolver delegates internally ✓
- ~~threes snap → aggressive silently reclassified to balanced~~ — resolver now preserves ALL valid snapshot stamps (not just "lotto") ✓

**RESOLVED SESSION AB:**
- ~~Canonical NBA slip path undesignated~~ — buildNbaSlipComposer canonical-nightly; buildSlipAi canonical-workstation; documented in NBA_CANONICAL_PATH_AUDIT_2026-05-09.md ✓
- ~~Session Z misdesignation of "5 overlapping NBA slip builders"~~ — true picture: 2 active (buildNbaSlipComposer + buildSlipAi) + 1 utility (buildNbaAiSlips) + 2 dead (buildNbaSlipEngine + buildNbaDynamicSlipEngine) ✓
- ~~aiRange consumption gap not surfaced~~ — confirmed: aiRange computed by buildNbaAiPicks, consumed by NEITHER active engine; absorbed only by orphans. Phase 2.I scope. ✓
- ~~Correlation logic ownership undocumented~~ — confirmed living only in orphan buildNbaDynamicSlipEngine; Phase 2.G absorption plan defined ✓

**RESOLVED SESSION AA:**
- ~~NBA lotto slips empty (classification layer)~~ — snapshotSourced guard preserves "lotto" stamps in both normalizeCandidate() instances ✓
- ~~PRA volRealism penalty~~ — lotto explicit slot 0.65 prevents scoring regression vs aggressive 0.66 ✓

**RESOLVED SESSION Z:**
- ~~NBA ecology audit not done~~ — full 20-section audit complete; health score 2.9/10; 7-phase roadmap defined ✓

**RESOLVED SESSION Y:**
- ~~`isOffensiveAttackStat` duplicated~~ — unified in normalizers.js ✓
- ~~Compactors inline in workstationRoutes.js~~ — extracted to buildWorkstationCompactors.js ✓
- ~~`__refreshInProgress` dual-mutex~~ — unified to module-level ✓
- ~~11,185 lines of dead inlined NBA code~~ — deleted ✓
- ~~4 empty stub directories~~ — deleted ✓
- ~~betting2.db orphan artifacts~~ — deleted ✓
